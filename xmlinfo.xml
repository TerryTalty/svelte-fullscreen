 	<description>&lt;p&gt;Exceptional property with a flooplan that is hard to beat and views that inspire. Mount Quandary, the highest peak in Summit County, looms large outside the windows. Big vaulted ceilings and large windows throughout the home take advantage of these views. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The living area is open from the kitchen, through the dining area to the living room. A very private master suite is onthe top level, with vaulted ceilings, big closets and beautiful bathroom finishes. A rec room, or potential fourth bedroom is on the lower level and currently has built-in bunk beds and another bath. The price is exceptional and is offered beautifully furnished.
	 &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;
